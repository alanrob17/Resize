# Resize

Resize is a console program to resize a folder structure of images. It will take a root folder and recurse through all sub-folders creating a list of original sized images. The program will then resize a copy of each image into a new folder structure.

This makes the images around 800 pixels width or height. It can drastically reduce the size of images.
