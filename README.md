# Resize

Resize is a console program to resize a folder of images. It will take a root folder and recurse through all sub-folders creating a list of original sized images. The program will then resize a copy of each image into the **resized** folder structure.

This makes the images 80% of their original width. It reduces the total size of images by about 50%.
